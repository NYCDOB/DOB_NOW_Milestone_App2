There was a steady increase in the number of approved CN permits since 2012, with an 82% increase from 2012 to 2016 and a 23% increase from 2015 to 2016. In Manhattan, CD105 had the greatest number of CN permits approved in 2012 and 2013, while CD104 experienced the greatest number of permits approved in 2014 and 2015.

    about: 'The number of crane accidents in 2016 has increased by 80% from the previous year and 157% from 2007. Manhattan experienced the majority of accidents within the 10 year period of 2007 - 2016, accounting for 70% of all crane accidents, while Staten Island and the Bronx had the least number of accidents (1% and 3% respectively). The crane types most associated with an accident are tower cranes accounting for 48% of the accidents occurring between 2007 and 2016. Mobile truck cranes were the second highest crane type associated with an accident accounting for 33% of accidents. There were a total of 37 injuries and 5 fatalities associated with crane accidents between 2007 and 2016. The greatest number of injuries associated with a crane accident occurred in 2013 and 2015 (9 injuries each year). 2016 experienced the greatest number of fatalities associated with a crane accident with a total of 3 (2 of which occurred at the same site on the same date in Queens). Manhattan experienced the greatest number of injuries and fatalities between 2007 and 2016 accounting for 62% of the total. Queens experienced the second greatest number of injuries and fatalities accounting for 24% of the total. The crane type associated with the greatest number of injuries and fatalities are mobile truck cranes accounting for 50% of the total.',

    about: 'Of all characteristics, age is one of the greatest predictors of migration. NYC consistently attracts large numbers of people in their 20s, and generally sees net migration losses of people in all other age groups. This is tied to the lifecycle of migration, whereby young single people move to the city, and leave after family formation. Over the past 30 years, net migration among those in their 20s has grown more positive.  While net migration was still negative for most other age groups, the most recent period has seen a reduction in net losses for most age groups.',
